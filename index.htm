            About me!!!!!! i like programming and art sometimes.
            i mostly do js because I really like the idea of being able to share things so freely through the web with people on all sorts of devices!!
            i like to focus a lot on backwards-compatibility because that means everyone will have the same experience on my page and consistency!!!!
            is why i do programming!!!!!! i really like making things which is why i like art but programming is more consistent.
