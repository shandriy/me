Welcome to my website!!!

I don't know what to put here but hopefully ill update it later
languages: english, russian. @entyspite on discord. she/they

About me!!!!!! i like programming and art sometimes.
i mostly do js because I really like the idea of being able to share things so freely through the web with people on all sorts of devices!!
i like to focus a lot on backwards-compatibility because that means everyone will have the same experience on my page and consistency!!!!
is why i do programming!!!!!! i really like making things which is why i like art but programming is more consistent.

fav games!!

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34038420) favorite game atm!!!!
- prsk. i like rhythm games. havent been playing it that much recently but i havent been playing anything much recently other than osu
- sdvx. going to arcades for sdvx is the only reason i would go outside
- genshin i would put my uid but im too lazy to check
- hollow knight!!!!!!! i havent played it in a while but still one of my favorite games

fav music artists

- mori calliope/demondice havent been listening to her that much recently but overall keep returning to her like. more often than with other artists
- schnozz. ok this is very much temporary imo ill probably forget abt him in a month but atm this is basically all i listen to
- inabakumori kinda random. i just listen to them whenever i feel like which isnt very often but also i keep returning so. also not all the songs are on spotify which sucks but oh well
