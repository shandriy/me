## new layout

---

wow!!!

finally a new layout!!

yep i actually updated my website. i dont really have much to say so i guess this is more of an announcement kinda. i still dont like it very much but its better than it was before.

it also uses a (terrible) ssg now so itll be easier to transition to something better later

source is on [github](https://github.com/shandriy/me) and the old layout is there too

some links might be broken because previously i used URL hash for navigation but ill try to get that fixed

still no mobile support and chrome 1 no longer works

thanks
